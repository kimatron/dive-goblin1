            <div class="faq-answer">
                While we can neither confirm nor deny our goblin status, we chose the name because, like goblins, we're obsessed with treasure... except our treasure is finding the best diving gear at the best prices! Plus, have you seen how goblins hoard shiny things? That's basically what our warehouse looks like, but with diving equipment.

                Nope! While we appreciate a good "BLARGHHH!" now and then, we speak all human languages. Our customer service team is fluent in English, Spanish, and occasionally dolphin (still in training for that one).

                <span>How fast do you ship? Are we talking human-speed or goblin-speed?</span>

            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                We ship at goblin-speed (which is surprisingly fast)! Standard delivery takes 3-5 business days within Ireland. Our gob-express shipping (next-day delivery) is available for when you need your gear faster than a goblin can say "SCUBA". International shipping times vary, as our delivery goblins sometimes get distracted by shiny objects.

            <div class="faq-answer">
                We ship worldwide! Our network of underwater tunnels... er, we mean, shipping partners, can deliver to most countries. Shipping costs vary by location and whether Mercury is in retrograde. Note: We cannot ship to Atlantis (they're still mad about that incident with the trident).

                Orders over €{{ free_delivery_threshold }} get free shipping! Why €{{ free_delivery_threshold }}? Because our accountant goblin insisted on a round number, and who are we to argue with someone who can do math while hanging upside down?

            <div class="faq-answer">
                All our equipment is certified by the highest diving authorities! While we may be goblins, we take safety VERY seriously. Every piece of gear meets or exceeds international safety standards. We test everything ourselves - if it can survive a goblin's underwater adventure, it can survive anything!

            <div class="faq-answer">
                No riddles required! We offer a simple 30-day return policy on unused items in original packaging. Though if you want to solve a riddle, our customer service goblins know plenty! Just don't try returning used wetsuits - we can smell fear... and saltwater.

            <div class="faq-answer">
                Check our detailed size guide! We've measured everything in both human and goblin sizes (just kidding, it's all human sizes). If you're between sizes, our expert fitting goblins recommend sizing down - wetsuits stretch, but a loose wetsuit is about as useful as a chocolate teapot underwater.

                Easy peasy goblin squeezy! Just return it within 30 days for a different size. Our returns process is so simple, even a cave troll could do it (and they have terrible hand-eye coordination).

                Whether you're diving in the Arctic, exploring tropical waters, or searching for underwater treasure (that's our specialty!), we've got gear for every situation. Just don't ask about our mermaid-spotting equipment - that's still in beta testing.

                Please release him back into the ocean - we're still paying off the legal fees from the last time someone tried to claim that reward. However, if you spot our mascot (the Diving Goblin) in the wild, snap a pic for 10% off your next order!
