# Dive Goblin - Testing Documentation
## GIF Demonstrations of Dive Goblin Functionality

Due to ongoing issues with deployed site styling not loading correctly despite extensive troubleshooting (including collecting static files and checking AWS bucket settings), I am providing GIFs to showcase the core functionality of Dive Goblin as it appears on the local development server. These GIFs demonstrate that the primary features work as intended and offer insight into user interactions with the site.

### Why Include GIF Demonstrations?
Displaying GIFs of the functional local version of Dive Goblin serves to:
- **Provide Proof of Concept**: Demonstrate that the features are implemented and work as expected in a controlled environment.
- **Highlight User Experience**: Offer a clear visualization of how users can navigate and utilize the e-commerce platform.
- **Assist Reviewers and Stakeholders**: Give context to potential issues in the deployed version and highlight the difference between local functionality and deployment outcomes.

### Features Demonstrated
1. **User Authentication**
   - Log In / Log Out  
     ![Log In / Log Out GIF](media/documentation/registerloginoutnewsletter.gif)
   - Register User / Sign Up for Newsletter

   - About Us Page  
     ![About Us Page GIF](link-to-about-us-page-gif)
   - Privacy Policy Page  
     ![Privacy Policy GIF](media/documentation/privacytermsfb.gif)
   - FAQ Page  
     ![FAQ Page GIF](link-to-faq-page-gif)
5. **Checkout Process**
   - Stripe Integration for Secure Payments  
     ![Stripe Checkout GIF](link-to-stripe-checkout-gif)
   - Order Confirmation Page  
     ![Order Confirmation GIF](link-to-order-confirmation-gif)

By including these GIFs, I aim to provide an overview that ensures the functionality can be reviewed effectively, even with current styling issues on the deployed version.


I have no idea why my site changes in appearance with Debug settings changed from true to false, but then they also work on false on my local deployed version sometimes, but not when pushed to Heroku.

9. [Conclusion](#conclusion)

## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the testing strategy and results for the Dive Goblin e-commerce project. It includes details on unit, integration, end-to-end, and manual testing.

## Test Environment Setup
1. Set up a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
2. Install testing dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements-test.txt
    ```

## Unit Testing
Unit tests are written using the `unittest` framework to verify the functionality of individual components.

### Example Unit Test
```python
from django.test import TestCase
from .models import Product

class ProductModelTest(TestCase):
    def test_product_creation(self):
        product = Product.objects.create(name="Dive Mask", price=29.99)
        self.assertEqual(product.name, "Dive Mask")
        self.assertEqual(product.price, 29.99)
```

# BUGS noticed along the way:

#### Go to top button doesn't work unless user is logged in for some reason.

#### Stock numbers don't correlate - 5 items in stock but can purchase 10 eg

#### Favicon not loading properly

#### Images not uploading to aws from front end product management - need to be forced upload with script

#### Various responsive issues on front end - shopping cart not displaying correctly

#### Javascript not loading properly in development causing issues such as quantity button not loading properly or modals not opening/closing - lots of issues with set up using aws - not loading from local static etc

#### Navigation drop down menu obscuring main body, bad ux

### When deleting/editing products in product management, there is no delete confirmation stage, and once an action is completed the user is taken out of the product management section. Not a big issue, just bad ux

## Bug Report: AWS S3 Storage Configuration Issue

### Description
Images uploaded through the Django admin and product management interface were not automatically uploading to the AWS S3 bucket. Files were being saved locally instead of to the configured S3 storage, despite AWS credentials being correctly configured.

### Impact
- **Severity**: High
- **Affected Areas**: Product management, media file uploads, static file collection
- **User Experience**: Images uploaded in production were not persisting between deployments
- **Data Loss Risk**: Media files could be lost during Heroku dyno restarts

### Symptoms Observed
- ✅ AWS credentials were correctly configured
- ✅ S3 bucket existed and was accessible
- ✅ Manual upload script using boto3 worked perfectly
- ❌ Django admin uploads saved to local filesystem
- ❌ `collectstatic` command saved files locally
- ❌ Product images were not visible on deployed site

### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Cause**: Django version incompatibility with storage configuration

The application was using Django 5.1, but the AWS S3 storage was configured using **deprecated settings** that were removed in Django 4.2+:

```python
# ❌ DEPRECATED - No longer works in Django 5.1
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
```

**Contributing Factors**:
1. Django 5.1 completely ignores the old `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` setting
2. The new `STORAGES` dictionary format was not implemented
3. No deprecation warnings were visible during development
4. Manual boto3 script worked, masking the Django configuration issue

### Solution Implemented

**1. Updated Storage Configuration**
Replaced deprecated settings with Django 5.1 compatible `STORAGES` dictionary:

```python
# ✅ NEW - Works with Django 5.1
STORAGES = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": "storages.backends.s3.S3Storage",
        "OPTIONS": {
            "access_key": AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
            "secret_key": AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
            "bucket_name": AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME,
            "region_name": AWS_S3_REGION_NAME,
            "default_acl": "public-read",
            "location": "media",
        },
    },
    "staticfiles": {
        "BACKEND": "storages.backends.s3.S3Storage",
        "OPTIONS": {
            # ... static file configuration
            "location": "static",
        },
    },
}
```

**2. Removed Dependencies**
- Deleted unused `custom_storages.py` file
- Removed deprecated setting references

**3. Testing Process**
```bash
# Local testing with S3
export USE_AWS=true
python manage.py runserver

# Static files test
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

# Production deployment
git push heroku main
```

### Verification Steps
1. ✅ Local admin upload → files appear in S3 bucket
2. ✅ Product management upload → automatic S3 storage
3. ✅ Static files collection → CSS/JS files in S3
4. ✅ Production deployment → images persist correctly
5. ✅ Image URLs resolve to S3 domain

### Prevention Measures
- **Documentation**: Updated deployment guide with Django 5.1 requirements
- **Testing**: Added S3 storage verification to deployment checklist
- **Monitoring**: Implemented storage backend logging for future debugging

### Lessons Learned
- Always check Django version compatibility when upgrading
- Deprecated settings may fail silently without obvious error messages
- Manual workarounds (boto3 script) can mask underlying configuration issues
- The new `STORAGES` format provides better separation of static vs media file handling

- [Django 4.2 Storage Migration Guide](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/releases/4.2/#storages)

### Time to Resolution
- **Detection**: 5 days (masked by working manual script)
- **Investigation**: 2 hours (comparing Django versions)
- **Implementation**: 30 minutes (settings update)
- **Testing & Verification**: 1 hour

**Status**: ✅ **Resolved**  
**Fixed in**: Commit - "Fix S3 storage for Django 5.1"  
**Verified**: Production deployment successful with automatic S3 uploads
