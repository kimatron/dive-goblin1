# Dive Goblin - Testing Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive testing documentation for the Dive Goblin e-commerce platform. All core functionality has been thoroughly tested across multiple browsers, devices, and user scenarios to ensure a robust and reliable shopping experience. 

As well as the documentation tables in this file, GIFs of most functions and tests in action can be found in the README.md file, showcasing the features and functions of the site.

I am happy with most of the Lighthouse reports, though they are a little low on some pages for mobile site. There are still some small contrasting issues on some sections of the site, but most of them have been dealt with, along with all missing aria labels.

I had to change the color scheme last minute due to low contrast errors in WAVE, which I am not entirely happy about, but it fixed (most of) the errors :)

| Bug ID | Description | Solution | Date Fixed | Evidence |
|--------|-------------|----------|------------|-----------|
| **BUG-FIX-006** | Shopping cart quantity update not working | Fixed form field naming mismatch between template and view | 2025-01 | Cart updates now work correctly |

### Example Bug Fix: Shopping Cart Quantity Update Issue

**Problem:**
Users could change quantities in the shopping cart using +/- buttons, but clicking "Update" had no effect. The cart quantities would revert to their original values.

**Root Cause:**
Form field naming mismatch between template and view expectations:

```html
<!-- ❌ BEFORE - Template was sending -->
<input type="number" name="quantity" value="{{ item.quantity }}">
<input type="hidden" name="item_id" value="{{ item.item_id }}">

# ❌ View was expecting field names like:
for item_id, quantity in request.POST.items():
    if item_id.startswith('quantity_'):  # Looking for 'quantity_123' format
  ```
**Solution:**

Updated template to match view expectations:

```html
<!-- ✅ AFTER - Template now sends -->
<input type="number" name="quantity_{{ item.item_id }}" value="{{ item.quantity }}">
```


### Example Bug Fix: AWS S3 Storage Issue
```py
# BEFORE (Deprecated Django 4.1 settings)
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'

# AFTER (Django 5.1 compatible)
STORAGES = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": "storages.backends.s3.S3Storage",
        "OPTIONS": {
            "access_key": AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
            "secret_key": AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
            "bucket_name": AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME,
            # ... additional options
        },
    },
    "staticfiles": {
        "BACKEND": "storages.backends.s3.S3Storage",
        "OPTIONS": {
            # ... static file configuration
        },
    },
}
```

# BUGS noticed along the way:

#### Go to top button doesn't work unless user is logged in for some reason.

#### Weird caching on safari from a link in whatsapp. Even though the domain is the same, when I click the old whatsapp link it brings me to an old cached badlayout version of the site, but if I click another link from the email with the same domain I get the up to date version.

#### Stock numbers don't correlate - 5 items in stock but can purchase 10 eg

#### Favicon not loading properly - FIXED

#### Images not uploading to aws from front end product management - need to be forced upload with script - FIXED

#### Various responsive issues on front end - shopping cart not displaying correctly - FIXED

#### Javascript not loading properly in development causing issues such as quantity button not loading properly or modals not opening/closing - lots of issues with set up using aws - not loading from local static etc - FIXED 2/6/25

#### Navigation drop down menu obscuring main body, bad ux - FIXED 22/5/25

#### When deleting/editing products in product management, there is no delete confirmation stage, and once an action is completed the user is taken out of the product management section. Not a big issue, just bad ux. -FIXED 9/6/25

## Bug Report: AWS S3 Storage Configuration Issue

### Description
Images uploaded through the Django admin and product management interface were not automatically uploading to the AWS S3 bucket. Files were being saved locally instead of to the configured S3 storage, despite AWS credentials being correctly configured.

### Impact
- **Severity**: High
- **Affected Areas**: Product management, media file uploads, static file collection
- **User Experience**: Images uploaded in production were not persisting between deployments
- **Data Loss Risk**: Media files could be lost during Heroku dyno restarts

### Symptoms Observed
- ✅ AWS credentials were correctly configured
- ✅ S3 bucket existed and was accessible
- ✅ Manual upload script using boto3 worked perfectly
- ❌ Django admin uploads saved to local filesystem
- ❌ `collectstatic` command saved files locally
- ❌ Product images were not visible on deployed site

### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Cause**: Django version incompatibility with storage configuration

The application was using Django 5.1, but the AWS S3 storage was configured using **deprecated settings** that were removed in Django 4.2+:

```python
# ❌ DEPRECATED - No longer works in Django 5.1
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
```

**Contributing Factors**:
1. Django 5.1 completely ignores the old `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` setting
2. The new `STORAGES` dictionary format was not implemented
3. No deprecation warnings were visible during development
4. Manual boto3 script worked, masking the Django configuration issue

### Solution Implemented

**1. Updated Storage Configuration**
Replaced deprecated settings with Django 5.1 compatible `STORAGES` dictionary:

```python
# ✅ NEW - Works with Django 5.1
STORAGES = {
    "default": {
        "BACKEND": "storages.backends.s3.S3Storage",
        "OPTIONS": {
            "access_key": AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
            "secret_key": AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
            "bucket_name": AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME,
            "region_name": AWS_S3_REGION_NAME,
            "default_acl": "public-read",
            "location": "media",
        },
    },
    "staticfiles": {
        "BACKEND": "storages.backends.s3.S3Storage",
        "OPTIONS": {
            # ... static file configuration
            "location": "static",
        },
    },
}
```

**2. Removed Dependencies**
- Deleted unused `custom_storages.py` file
- Removed deprecated setting references

**3. Testing Process**
```bash
# Local testing with S3
export USE_AWS=true
python manage.py runserver

# Static files test
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

# Production deployment
git push heroku main
```

### Verification Steps
1. ✅ Local admin upload → files appear in S3 bucket
2. ✅ Product management upload → automatic S3 storage
3. ✅ Static files collection → CSS/JS files in S3
4. ✅ Production deployment → images persist correctly
5. ✅ Image URLs resolve to S3 domain

### Prevention Measures
- **Documentation**: Updated deployment guide with Django 5.1 requirements
- **Testing**: Added S3 storage verification to deployment checklist
- **Monitoring**: Implemented storage backend logging for future debugging

### Lessons Learned
- Always check Django version compatibility when upgrading
- Deprecated settings may fail silently without obvious error messages
- Manual workarounds (boto3 script) can mask underlying configuration issues
- The new `STORAGES` format provides better separation of static vs media file handling
